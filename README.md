## Hi! I'm **codist**.
I am an English **programmer** located in **Canada**. 🇨🇦

I like to create random projects or games just for the fun of it, even if they *aren't particularly useful.*\
If you would like to chat with me about anything, reach out to me on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/imcodist.xyz)!

My current **profile picture** is by [_VioMarks_](https://bsky.app/profile/viomarks.bsky.social).

<sub>If you can't find one of my projects here it may be in my [dump org](https://github.com/codists-dump).</sub>
